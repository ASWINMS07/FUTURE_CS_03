# 🛡️ Task 3 - Wi-Fi Security Assessment

As part of the **Future Interns Cybersecurity Track**, this task involved assessing the security of my personal Wi-Fi network using penetration testing tools.

---

## 🔹 Task Objective

Conduct a Wi-Fi security assessment to:

- Detect weak passwords
- Identify open ports
- Find unauthorized devices

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- `Nmap` – to scan the network and check for connected devices & open ports  
- `Wireshark` – to capture and analyze network traffic

---

## 🖼️ Screenshots

### 🔍 Nmap Scan Results

---

## ✅ Findings

- Found multiple devices on the network using Nmap
- Analyzed packet flow using Wireshark
- No suspicious traffic was observed
- Router running on IP `192.168.29.1`
- No dangerous ports (e.g., Telnet) exposed

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

- Ensure router uses strong WPA2 or WPA3 password
- Disable WPS if enabled
- Regularly review connected device list
- Update router firmware to avoid known vulnerabilities
- Set firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ports
