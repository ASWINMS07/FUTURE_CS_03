This repository contains the Wi-Fi security assessment report for a personal home network, completed as part of the Future Interns initiative.

---

✅ **Task Objective**  
Conduct a wireless network security audit by identifying open ports, analyzing network traffic, and detecting possible vulnerabilities or unauthorized devices.

---

🛠️ **Tools Used**  
- Nmap  
- Wireshark  
- Manual Packet Analysis

---

🔍 **Key Findings**  
- Router identified at `192.168.29.1` with standard HTTP/HTTPS ports open  
- No high-risk services like Telnet or FTP found  
- No unauthorized devices were detected  
- Wireshark analysis showed only regular encrypted traffic and no suspicious packets

---

🛡️ **Recommendations**  
- Use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption with a strong password  
- Disable WPS to reduce brute-force vulnerability  
- Regularly monitor connected devices on the router admin panel  
- Keep router firmware up to date  
- Enable a firewall and block unused ports
